# 🧠 AIWidget™ — Official Standard by Cultivating Ai

[![AIWidget Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard-AIWidget™-brightgreen)](https://github.com/CultivatingAi/AIWidget)


> **AIWidget™**: The canonical agentic widget framework for modular, memory-driven, versioned cognitive components—defined and stewarded by Cultivating Ai, creators of LouieOS.

---

## Executive Summary

AIWidget™ is the official, production-ready architecture for cognitive, agent-powered widgets that power modern modular OS and LLM-native platforms.  
Our standard delivers robust, portable, and secure agent widgets—combining persistent memory, auditability, and seamless UI+logic fusion. This repo is the industry reference.

---

## 📈 Key Differentiators

- **Modular**: Design, import, and deploy any AIWidget into LouieOS or compatible agentic OS in seconds.
- **Memory & Audit-Driven**: All widgets maintain internal state (`memory.json`), audit trails (`audit.log`), and sealed versions (`safe.lock`).
- **Portable & Immutable**: Widgets are portable folders—exportable, versioned, and locked for integration, sharing, and compliance.
- **Drag-and-Drop Deployable**: Compose, test, and share UI+agent blocks visually or via API, no code rewrites required.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Immutability, manifest contracts, and audit by design—engineered for real team, legal, and regulatory environments.

## 📐 Official Folder Structure

Every AIWidget lives in its own folder:

AIWidget_<name>/
├── manifest.json # Widget metadata and config
├── logic.py # Agent logic (read-only, memory-safe)
├── memory.json # Per-widget persistent memory
├── safe.lock # Versioning/immutability control
├── audit.log # Audit history: every access/change
├── README.md # Widget usage/docs

See `widget_template/` for a drop-in starter.

## 💡 Why AIWidget™?

Traditional agents are “invisible” code.  
**AIWidget™** is a true building block for the post-agentic era:

- Visual, memory-enabled UI + agent logic—always portable and safe
- Each widget is a shareable, remixable “mini-team” for agentic tasks
- No black-box execution: every state transition, access, and edit is traceable and auditable by design
- Non-destructive: team members and AIs can iterate without risking working widgets

**Result:**  
Deploy confidently across organizations, or share with the community—provenance, compliance, and transparency built in.
